## 🎯 Problem Statement

Modern DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering teams face critical challenges:

- **Alert Fatigue**: Engineers overwhelmed by constant notifications
- **Manual Response**: Human-dependent incident detection and resolution
- **High MTTR**: Long Mean Time to Resolution during critical failures
- **Reactive Approach**: Firefighting instead of proactive problem solving
- **Burnout & Stress**: Engineers under constant pressure during outages
- **Business Impact**: Downtime leading to revenue loss and customer churn

## ✨ Our Solution: Digital SRE Team

We've built an **autonomous multi-agent AI system** that acts as a complete digital SRE team, handling incidents from detection to resolution without human intervention.

### 🤖 The AI Agent Team

1. **🔍 Sentinel Agent**
   - Continuously monitors logs and system metrics
   - Detects anomalies and potential issues in real-time
   - Triggers incident response workflows

2. **🩺 First Responder Agent**
   - Automatically diagnoses root causes
   - Uses Gemini's function-calling with system tools
   - Performs deep analysis of failure patterns

3. **🧠 Commander Agent**
   - Decides optimal remediation strategies
   - Advanced reasoning for complex incident scenarios
   - Prioritizes actions based on business impact

4. **⚙️ Engineer Agent**
   - Translates remediation plans into precise commands
   - Executes fixes safely with rollback capabilities
   - Handles deployments, scaling, and configuration changes

5. **📢 Communicator Agent**
   - Generates clear incident reports
   - Provides natural language summaries for developers
   - Maintains incident documentation and post-mortems

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (Latest LTS version)
- Google AI API credentials
- Firebase project setup
- Target infrastructure access (for monitoring)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kalashjain9/studio.git
   cd studio
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   Configure the following:
   ```env
   GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   FIREBASE_CONFIG=your_firebase_config
   MONITORING_ENDPOINTS=your_infrastructure_endpoints
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Initialize AI agents**
   ```bash
   npm run genkit:dev
   ```

6. **Access the dashboard**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002)

## 📜 Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server (port 9002)
- `npm run genkit:dev` - Start AI agent development server
- `npm run genkit:watch` - Start AI agents with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Code quality checks
- `npm run typecheck` - TypeScript validation

## 🔧 Agent Configuration

### Setting Up Monitoring Targets

```typescript
// Configure your infrastructure endpoints
const monitoringConfig = {
  services: ['api-gateway', 'database', 'cache'],
  metrics: ['cpu', 'memory', 'response_time'],
  thresholds: {
    cpu: 80,
    memory: 85,
    response_time: 1000
  }
}
```

### Customizing Response Actions

```typescript
// Define custom remediation strategies
const remediationStrategies = {
  'high-cpu': ['scale-up', 'restart-service'],
  'memory-leak': ['restart-container', 'allocate-memory'],
  'deployment-failure': ['rollback', 'notify-team']
}
```

## 📊 Key Benefits

- **⚡ Faster Resolution**: Automated response reduces MTTR by 80%
- **🛡️ Proactive Prevention**: Early detection prevents cascading failures
- **💰 Cost Efficiency**: Reduced downtime saves operational costs
